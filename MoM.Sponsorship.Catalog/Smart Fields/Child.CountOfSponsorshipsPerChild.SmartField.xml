  /* **********************************************************************************
  Query for smart field to calculate the count of sponsors that a child had.  
  Currenntly this query runs off of 4 views. the first 3 to sort through the data to 
  verify that we are using a sponsor that is truly linked to the current child (and not 
  a reused child id, issues from the last last system).
  The 4th view filters criteria that Andrew VAnderput requested that the child knew 
  they were sponsored in order to count the sponsorship. This was done by saying if the 
  child knew they were sponsored they would write a letter to the sponsor. The data
  was most accurate after 5/1/2009. Before this date we based that a child knew they
  were sponsored if the sponsorship was more than 60 days in length. 
  ********************************************************************************** */

   
  Remarks:      This is used to count the number of sponsors a child had, based on if the child corresponded to the sponsor,
                        or (before 5/1/2009) if the length of sponsorship was over 60 days.
