	<!-- 
	Remarks:    This sproc is used by the CopyCreditCard.Add form. The @revenueId value passed in will get its credit card replaced with the credit card
				associated with the @revenueLookupId recurring gift!

	History:
	Date            Modified By     Comments
	19-Dec-2012		Memphis			Initial Version - will copy a credit card from one recurring gift to another, for the given sponsor.
	28-Dec-2012		Memphis			Changed to use the Constituent from the Revenue view, not the Sponsorship because the Credit Card 
									could be used for a Gift, not a sponsorship payment!
	29-Dec-2012		Memphis			Added the optional parameter so we can call this and override the check for the same constituent, so that
									the user can actually use the credit card from a different constituent/payer/donor. This will be called
									from a new Action Task called "Apply different Credit Card"
	28-Aug-2015		CMayeda			Changed raiserror syntax to work with SQL Server 2012 (CRM 4.0)
	24-Oct-2016		Memphis			Insert this change into the new RG Amendment table so this change displays in the built-in
									RG Activity Datalist:  new for 4.0
									need to get these values: Previous and Current to insert into RG Amendment table:
									CARDHOLDERNAME	
									CREDITTYPECODEID						
									CREDITCARDPARTIALNUMBER	
									EXPIRESON
									CREDITTYPECODEID
									PREVIOUSCREDITTYPECODEID
